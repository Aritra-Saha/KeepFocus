# KeepFocus
An android app that helps users keep focused on their personal goals by using a variety of focus techniques.
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our personal lack of motivation and productivity during this quarantine. Since we were sent home because of the coronavirus pandemic, we had to continue our studies at home. However, it has been hard to stay focused and motivated on completing our studies while faced with distractions at home. Personally, I have been playing video games and sleeping more than actually studying. Since we knew that these problems are being faced by every university student, we decided to make an app to try to help those like ourselves who are feeling a lack of motivation right now and to help them focus and work hard to achieve success in their academics.
## General Information
This is an app that incorporates three effective study techniques in one app and allows the user to choose which one they want to incorporate. The first study technique is the Pomodoro technique, which is when someone continuously works for a period of time and then takes a short break; this was incorporated in the app using a timer. The second technique is "Don't break the chain" which is a technique in which you try to outline the goals you want to achieve in one day and then cross them off as you continue to achieve them; this is done using an expandable list. The third technique is "Get Work Done" which allows the user to add their own short term and long term goals in the app and cross them off as they continue to complete them. The app also has a feature in which you can keep the phone locked on the app to minimize distractions and it presents a random motivational quote each time the app is opened. The user is free to use whichever one of the techniques they want or a mixture of the techniques.
